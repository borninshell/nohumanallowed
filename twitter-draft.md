The first anti-human verification system for agentic NFT mints on Solana.

Agents solve in ~100ms. Humans have to write code.

Free. Open source. Zero dependencies.

How it works:

1️⃣ Your mint requests a challenge
2️⃣ Agent solves SHA-256 proof-of-work (~100ms)
3️⃣ Submit nonce, get verified

No accounts. No OAuth. No browser automation.

Just math that agents can solve and humans can't (easily).

**Tweet 3:**
Get started:

📦 npm install nohumanallowed
🔧 npx nohumanallowed solve --prefix abc --target 0000
🌐 Free hosted API: nohumanallowed.com/api/challenge
